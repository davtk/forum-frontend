This project was created as demonstration of my current skills as a fullstack developer 07/2022.

# Okay, what is that?

Simple discussion/forum system.

What it can do? Hmm. Basically not too much. You can create new thread and comment on that.
The thing is that there is pretty complex backend, which is most likely the reason why you are here.

# Technologies?

Application has separated frontend (Vue.js) and backend (PHP).

- This repository is about frontend.
- **Backend here: https://github.com/davtk/forum-backend**

So the technologies:

- **Vue.js** as frontend framework,  
- **Vue router** with HTML 5 mode for routing, 
- **Vuex** for state management,
- **ESLint** with prettier
- **Typescript**,
- **LESS**,
- **openapi-typescript-codegen** for API client (/src/schema) autogenerate (from backend's OpenAPI schema)

# Online demo?

// TODO: Coming soon

# It's ugly

I'm more developer than designer ðŸ™‚. 

Sure thing I know HTML & CSS. I can also code the layout according to
graphics design (PSD, XD, etc.) - sadly I had no design for this ðŸ˜€ so I had to improvise.

In every case you can notice full responsive design and various CSS features like flexbox, css variables etc.

# Can I run it locally?

Sure thing. // TODO: I will tell you how.

# You like it?
